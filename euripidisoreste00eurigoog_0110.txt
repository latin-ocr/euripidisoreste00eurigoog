Termes sseoonrlpidiiset the time he composed his0restinirnotknovu,
bct lt is most likely he htd seen his finienti yesv. 'l'he scene he hes leid nt
Argos, where tlte incidente ere believed to have taken plnce npwnrds of ele·
ven centuries sud a half hefore Christ. Althmmh this pls is ‹rne of ms most
celebrsted of the Greek tmgedies, yet in its morel it is infflmous, sud ln its os·
nsnopne ludicrous nnd shsnrd.

Agamemnon, kluc of Mycenae und of Argos, hod married clytemnestruduuyh·
ter of Tyndsrm, ling of Spnrts3-nnd Agamemnone brother, hlenettus, hed
rottried Helen, clytemnestm's sister. By Agamemnon, Clytemnestm had three
duremort, Chrysothemi, Iphigenia, sud Electrs3 also one son, usined Orestide.
By Meneltus, llelen hml one daughter, called Hermiouli. As Orestes vves very
young tt the commencemeut of the Trojsn wer, he did not accompany his fs-
ther iu the expedition from Greece; end as his tendor age precludesl him from
king sufficient protection to liis mother durinc the necessary absence of her
husbsnd, lgnmemnon constituted his cousin AEglstlms (son of Thyestils by sn
inoestoom intercourse with lrls own daughter Pelopemguardisn of liis wife end
kingdom till he should return. AEelsthns (ss might well he expected) proved
nost unworthy of ths confideuce reposed iu him; for he uot only lived in edul-
tery nith Agamemnon's queen during the siege of Troy, bnt also imtignted her
to the murder of her 1οηί,οη his arrival in his mvn dominicus, efter the con·
streton of the vvsr. The young Orestes too, they would have put to death, hed
not his sister Electra coucesled him, end seut him privstely to the court of Strb-
puin, hine of Plintis-whose cousort vves hyememuou’s sister. llere Orestes
ves educmed vvlth his cousin Pylades—sud the attachment of the youths, their
effection for one another, become ss vvsrm sud sincere ss over united two mor·
trl hesrts. Their iuviolshle friendship‚ like thot of Dtmon and Pythias, ispro·
verbisl even to this day.

When Orestis came to msuhood, he betook himself ln diegulse, scoompsn'ed
by his faithful Pylades, to Mycenae, the resideuce of AEglsthus, distantnbont 14
English miles from Argos. lbere, by the suistence of his friend, he not only
mutuatos the adulterer, who had now married clytemnestra, und usurped the
sceptro: hut he liketvise, st the instigetlou of Electra, stnhs his own mother,
efter tternly upbrsidiug her with infidelity md cruelty to her first husband. No
morter, however, hed he perpetrsted the helnone crime of muricide, theo he be·
mures tormented by inermies, end repslring to Argos, thronis himself down ou
aconclt in front of the pelei-e of the deceased Agamemnon.

tyndarm, the father of clytemnestra, now meuses him of murder before the

'ves; sud orestes, to avoid being stoned to death, together nith his sister,
mices thet both he end Electra would before slight etone lor their cume, by ¹
