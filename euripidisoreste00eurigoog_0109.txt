any just conception of our received pronunciation?

The oratory of ancient Greece, as far as the oratory of a dead
language can toa living ear be conveyed, is perfectly elear; could
we only diveat ourselves bf prejudice‚ and discard our favorite er·
rora. How any man can acknowledge himself at a loss to compre·
hend the use of tbe Greek accents, the very polish and perfectiori ol
the language, Ι arn truly astonished. Yet with the exception of one
learned divine, who has treated satisfactorily and with perspicuity
the doctrine of Proparoxytons and Parcxytons, but who nevertheless
has written most absurdly on other points, 1 have nowhere met with
person or with book that has pretended to explain this most simple
aud easy enigma. Bishop Horsley, who in his Dissertation on the
Prosodics of the Greek and Latin languages, has advanced the far·
theat of all moderno in the elucidation of the subject of accentuations
may be advantageously consultari on· the stress of voice lo be laid on
the penult and antepenult of Greek words; though respecting the
grave aceent (aa it is called) of Oxytons, he has himself fallen into
gross error: whilst his suggestions, and illustratione of lones not ac-
tually marked, are most futile, and beyond endurance silly. It may
seem presumptuous in me to speak positively, yet positively lcan
speaks and, with leave, 1 will brietly develope the nature of 'Oxy-
tons. Every Greek word carrying on its final syllable the accent

’ called grave, was pronouneed with the stress of voice on the last syl·
lable, like the English words rejict, eountermeind, conde'mn. When
Oxytons stood by themselves, or constituted the next word before

, ansenelitic, or were last in asentence, the acute accent had its full
force in utterance, and was marked accordingly. But in every other
situation, although the stress of voice was preserved on the final syl·

lable of the Oxyton, yet that the first part of the word immediately

· following might not seem to a matur to be a portion of the preced-
ing word, the acute aoeent was in writing made to lean the other

way, to signify that aller pronounoing the socented syllable the
loudost end strongest in tha word, a perceptible intermption wat to

be made, in order notro conlound the words with one another. In

¹ every instance where Oxytons vvere followed by enclities, theenclitic

was pronouneed as part of the Oxyton3 and when any vverd not an
Oxyton took tha acute aocent on its final syllable before an enclitic,

great stress of voice, even though previously laid on one of the pre·
ceding syllables, was repeated on the final syllable thus marked, to

such a degree as to dmw into that word, like a constituent part of

lt, the enclitic which followed.
